Question: Design a Parking Lot System
You need to design a parking lot system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system should have the following requirements:

*The parking lot has multiple levels, and each level has multiple parking spots.

*There are different types of vehicles: motorcycles, cars, and buses.

*A motorcycle can park in a motorcycle spot or a compact spot.

*A car can park in a compact spot or a large spot.

*A bus requires five consecutive large spots to park.

*The system should support adding and removing vehicles from the parking lot.

*Implement methods to check if the parking lot is full.

Follow-up:
*How would you implement a strategy to find the nearest available parking spot?

*What modifications would you need to make if new types of vehicles are introduced?

Task:
Design the classes and relationships using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Implement the core methods needed for parking and removing vehicles.
